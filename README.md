# Comprehensive-Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project explores the dynamic nature of stock market data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization techniques, and predictive modeling to analyze and forecast stock prices. By leveraging real-time financial data from The Investors Exchange (IEX), we aim to provide insights into stock performance trends, assess risk, and predict future stock movements using historical data.

# Key Features:
* Data Acquisition: Retrieve real-time and historical stock data using the IEX API.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth analysis to understand market trends and stock behavior.
* Risk Analysis: Assess the risk of stocks based on historical performance.
* Monte Carlo Simulations: Use statistical methods to simulate and predict future stock prices.
* Data Visualization: Visualize key financial indicators and stock trends for better insights.

# Tools and Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python 3.6
# Libraries:
* Numpy v1.14.2: For numerical computations.
* Pandas v0.23.4: To handle and manipulate financial datasets.
* Pandas-datareader v0.6.0: For extracting data from various financial data sources, including IEX.
* Matplotlib v2.10.0: For generating static, animated, and interactive visualizations of financial data.
* Seaborn v0.8.0: For statistical data visualization.
* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook v5.6.0

# Data Source:
All financial data for this project is sourced from the IEX Developer API, using pandas-datareader. The data includes real-time stock quotes, historical price data, financial fundamentals, and market actions.

# Methodology:
* Data Collection: Stock data is pulled from the IEX API, including historical time-series data.
* Data Cleaning & Processing: The data is processed to handle missing values and align formats for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations and statistical techniques to understand stock performance over time.
* Risk Analysis: We use historical volatility and price trends to assess stock risk.
* Monte Carlo Method: A statistical approach is implemented to simulate various future price scenarios based on historical data, providing probabilistic price -predictions.

# Visualization & Analysis:
Line plots, histograms, and heatmaps are used to visualize stock trends and correlation among different stocks.
Analysis includes assessing volatility, moving averages, and return rates.

# Future Work:
Extending the model to include other predictive techniques like ARIMA, LSTM, and more advanced machine learning algorithms.
Integration of more data sources for a broader market perspective.
